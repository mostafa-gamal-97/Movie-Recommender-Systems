# Movie Recommender Systems
 Build a baseline Movie Recommender Systems using TMDB 5000 Dataset. This notebook will pretty much serve as a foundation in recommendation systems and will provide you something to start with.
 
 The types of systems we will be exploring are:
 
  1) Demographic Filtering Systems: Rank, Popularity, budget, and revenue based Systems.

  2) Content Based Systems.
